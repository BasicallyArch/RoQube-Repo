# RoQube Repo
 An open source Roblox Rhythm game worked on by me :fire:

Since this game is only being worked on by one person I'd like to bring this to being open-sourced, I thought about open-sourcing it for about 5 months until today and I've decided that it's time to open-source it!

Please check out the trailers or videos that have been made over the months here:
